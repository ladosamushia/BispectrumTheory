I will use this repository for code related to the modeling of galaxy
bispectrum. 

I will start with the tree-level (Scoccimarro) model and will be adding things
as necessary.

The main objective of this codebase is to support K-State Cosmic Frontier
group's initiative in fitting the BAO feature in DESI bispectrum.
